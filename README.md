This is a course project I built as part of Advanced CSS and SASS.  Features include a custom-built grid with floats, 7-in-1 SASS architecture, BEM methodology, and a background video.  Media queries ensure compatibility across multiple screen sizes, and cubic bezier functions create unique animations.
