# Natours

This is a course project I built as part of Advanced CSS and SASS.  The site in its entirety is codes without Javascript.  Site features and functionality are coded exclusively in HTML and CSS, no Javascript is present. Features include a custom-built grid with floats, 7-in-1 SASS architecture, and BEM methodology.  The layout includes responsive images, art directions, and a background video.  Media queries ensure compatibility across multiple screen sizes, and cubic bezier functions create unique animations.
