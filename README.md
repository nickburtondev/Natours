This is a course project I built as part of Advanced CSS and SASS.  Features include a custom-built grid with floats, 7-in-1 SASS architecture, and BEM methodology.  Media queries are used to ensure compatibility across multiple screen sizes, and cubic bezier functions are utilized to create unique animations.
