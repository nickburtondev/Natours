# Natours

This is a course project I built as part of Advanced CSS and SASS. Site is coded exclusively in HTML and CSS, no Javascript is present. Features include a custom-built grid with floats, 7-in-1 SASS architecture, and BEM methodology.  The layout includes responsive images, art directions, and a background video.  Media queries ensure compatibility across multiple screen sizes, and cubic bezier functions create unique animations.
